# Anchor Link 4.0 / Transport Protocol 2.0

Design goals

- Reduce complexity of browser transport
    - Phase out Fuel on the transport side
        - Allow signer to set flag indicating that they can handle applying co-signatures themselves
        - Handle the case where signer modifies the request by adding signatures (already does but not standardized)
        - Add flag link can use to say if the transaction can't be modified or isn't intended for broadcast (e.g. eosfinex signing a special login action)
- Simplify transport interface
    - Add unique request identifier to each call
    - Should be possible to implement the interface without keeping state
- Increase robustness
    - Fallback QR codes/ESR links for session requests
        - Displayed if unable to push transaction to device or device didn't respond in X seconds
        - Fallback request automatically re-establishes the session when signed
    - Callback service failover
    - API node failover
